## (Some) Hackathon Ideas

> Bow ties are cool.  But dashlets are cooler.  Have a system you need to integrate with the Sugar UI?  Brand new to Sugar 7 development?  Then Dashlets are a great way to get your feet wet.  Try creating a chart!  Everybody loves those.  We've got plenty of Sugar Engineers around that can help you too.  *Create your first (or 100th) Sugar 7 dashlet.*

> Tools make everybody's life easier.  Have you had ideas for a Sugar 7 development tool but your regular job keeps getting in the way?  Now's your chance to give it a shot with the help of some friends or newly met acquaintances.  *Prototype a Sugar 7 Development tool.*

> Everyone knows that in a big meeting with a prospective customer or execs, it's always LAPTOPS CLOSED and PHONES OFF.  Staring at a screen makes you appear disinterested and like you are not paying attention.  Sales is about relationships, your prospective customer will not buy from you if they do not trust you.  However, a sales person needs to be able to keep on top of any fires that might be starting at one of their other accounts or opportunities.  *Devise and prototype a wearable that allows a CRM user to get silent, unobtrusive, and PRECISE notifications without looking at their phone or laptop.*
