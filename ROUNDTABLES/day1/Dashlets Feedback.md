# Dashlets Feedback

* Can we have a demo dashlet put up on Github? [NOTE: Need the dashlets blog post at the same time.]

* Can we cover external integrations in dashlets?

Some dashlet examples that include integrations with 3rd party services are available at https://github.com/sugarcrm/examples as well as elsewhere in this UnCon git repository.
